# Group-Chat-Simulation
A project I did for my Object Oriented Programming class that follows a live group chatting format.

Classes:
* User - Constructs a GUI for each user. If a user wants to send a message, this will take care of getting the message displayed onto the user's screen.
* Server - This displays the message on each user in the server's screen.
* IUser - Interface for the User class.
* Main - Driver class.
